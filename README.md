Friday: AI-Powered Coding Assistant

Project Description

Friday is an AI-powered voice assistant tailored specifically for coders. It assists with coding-related challenges such as:

Finding syntax for basic pages or applications.

Providing guidance on folder structure for projects.

Allowing users to copy code snippets from lectures for easy implementation.

Automating coding tasks to enhance productivity.

Overview

Friday leverages speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and automation libraries to offer an interactive and hands-free coding assistant. It aims to streamline development by minimizing repetitive tasks and providing quick access to essential coding resources.
